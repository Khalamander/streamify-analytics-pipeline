- **Live risk factor** display with percentages
- **Color-coded alerts** based on severity
- **Interactive risk factor** breakdown

#### **Advanced Analytics**
- **Fraud score** calculation with 3 decimal precision
- **Risk factor** percentages for each transaction
- **Historical tracking** of user behavior
- **Pattern analysis** across transaction history

### **5. Data Generation for Testing**

#### **Realistic Transaction Data**
- **Enhanced transaction** generation with fraud-prone data
- **Geographic coordinates** for location-based detection
- **Device and browser** information for fingerprinting
- **Suspicious categories** (gift cards, prepaid cards)
- **High-risk payment methods** (cryptocurrency, wire transfers)

#### **Fraud Simulation**
- **5% chance** of high-value transactions (>$2,000)
- **Realistic coordinates** for geographic analysis
- **Varied device types** and browsers
- **Mixed payment methods** including suspicious ones

## 🎯 **Live Demo Capabilities**

### **What You Can See in the Dashboard:**
